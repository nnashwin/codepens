# Trexify
> God creates dinosaurs, God kills dinosaurs, God creates man, man kills God, man brings back dinosaurs

## Install
You need to download and add the script into an html file as such:
```
<script src="path/To/trexify.js"></script>
```

It is also recommended that you add an assets directory that is accessible by your index.html where you store the image and sound effect.

## Usage
Attach the function to an event with the paths to the image and sound effect files as your parameters.
```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", trexify('path/to/godzillaroar.mp3', 'path/to/trex.png'))
```
